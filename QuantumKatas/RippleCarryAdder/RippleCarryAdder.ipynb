    "# Ripple Carry Adder Kata\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Ripple Carry Adder** quantum kata is a series of exercises designed\n",
    "to get you familiar with ripple carry addition on a quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The simplest quantum adder, covered in part I, closely mirrors its classical counterpart,\n",
    "using the same basic components and the same algorithm.\n",
    "* Part II explores building an in-place adder.\n",
    "* A more complex version of an in-place adder covered in part III of the kata uses a different algorithm\n",
    "to reduce the number of ancillary qubits needed.\n",
    "* Finally, part IV covers building an in-place quantum subtractor.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to complete the [BasicGates kata](./../BasicGates/BasicGates.ipynb) before this one to get familiar with the basic gates used in quantum computing. The list of basic gates available in Q# can be found at [Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic). For the syntax of flow control statements in Q#, see [the Q# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/language/statements#control-flow).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.\n",
    "Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with // ... comments)\n",
    "with some Q# code that solves the task. To verify your answer, run the cell using Ctrl/âŒ˜+Enter.\n",
