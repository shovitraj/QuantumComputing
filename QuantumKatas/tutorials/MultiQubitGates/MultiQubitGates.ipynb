    "## Applying Gates to a Part of the System\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest thing we can do with multi-qubit systems is to apply gates to only a subset of qubits in the system. \n",
    "Similar to how it is sometimes possible to represent the state of a multi-qubit systems as a tensor product of single-qubit states, \n",
    "you can construct gates that modify the state of a multi-qubit system as tensor products of gates that affect parts of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example of applying single-qubit gates to one of the qubits of a two-qubit system.\n",
    "If you want to apply an $X$ gate to the first qubit of the system and do nothing to the second qubit,\n",
    "the resulting gate will be represented as a tensor product of an $X$ gate and the identity gate $I$ which corresponds to doing nothing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\otimes I =\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\otimes \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} =\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "    0 & 1 & 0 & 0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the same approach when applying several gates to independent parts of the system at the same time.\n",
    "For example, applying the $X$ gate to the first qubit and the $H$ gate to the second qubit would be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\otimes H =\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\otimes \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} =\n",

    "    0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "    1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "    1 & -1 & 0 & 0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that we can use [mixed-multiplication property of tensor product](../LinearAlgebra/LinearAlgebra.ipynb#Tensor-Product) to see that this is equivalent to applying $X$ gate to the first qubit and applying $H$ gate to the second qubit, in either order:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$X \\otimes H = (I X) \\otimes (H I) = (I \\otimes H) (X \\otimes I)$$\n",
    "> $$X \\otimes H = (X I) \\otimes (I H) = (X \\otimes I) (I \\otimes H)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be generalized to larger systems and gates that act on multiple qubits as well. \n",
    "It can be less straightforward if a multi-qubit gate is applied to a subset of qubits that are not \"adjacent\" to each other in the tensor product; we'll see an example later in this tutorial."

    "Typically the term \"controlled $U$ gate\" refers to the type of gate we've described previously, which applies the gate $U$ only if the control qubit(s) are in the $|1\\rangle$ state. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible, however, to define variants of controlled gates that use different states as control states. \n",
    "For example, an **anti-controlled** $U$ gate (sometimes called **zero-controlled**) applies a gate only if the control qubit is in the $|0\\rangle$ state. \n",
    "It is also possible to define control conditions in other bases, for example, applying the gate if the control qubit is in the $|+\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the variants of controlled gates can be expressed in terms of the controls described in previous sections, using the following sequence of steps:\n",
    "* First, apply a transformation on control qubits that will transform the state you want to use as control into the $|1...1\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "* Apply the regular controlled version of the gate.\n",
    "* Finally, undo the transformation on control qubits from the first step using the adjoint version of it (remember that the controlled operation should not modify the state of the control qubits).\n",

    "> \n",
    "> The sequence of steps that implement this variant are:\n",
    "> 1. Apply the $X$ gate to each control qubit that corresponds to a `false` element of the bit mask (in the example, that's just the second qubit). After this, if the control qubits started in the $|10\\rangle$ state, they'll end up in the $|11\\rangle$ state, and if they started in any other state, they'll end up in any state by $|11\\rangle$.\n",
    "> 2. Apply the regular controlled version of the gate.\n",
    "> 3. Apply the $X$ gate to the same qubits to return them to their original state."
