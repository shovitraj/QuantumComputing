# Guide for Installation and Setup

## 1. Download the Qiskit Tutorials

**Get the tutorials**<BR>

For the full experience, you can start by downloading the latest release of the
tutorials from [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-iqx-tutorials/releases).
Unzip the archive in the directory of your choice (this is the recommended
way).

To properly view and run the tutorials, you will need to install [Jupyter
Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

## 2. Install Qiskit, Qiskit Aqua and Qiskit Aqua Chemistry

At least [Python 3.5 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required
to install and use Qiskit. If you have multiple Python versions installed (and
particularly if the command `python --version` returns an incompatible
version), you will need to ensure that your versions are [managed
correctly](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-python).
This can be done using the `environment.yml` file, as detailed below.

When there are no issues with dependencies, Qiskit can be installed using

```
pip install qiskit
```

Or, a pre-installed Qiskit can be updated using

```
pip install -U qiskit
```

However, in case of issues with dependencies, we recommend the following
installation procedure:

1. **Install [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html)**

2. **Create conda environment for Qiskit and install packages** (with the
   accompanying `environment.yml` file)

```
cd qiskit-iqx-tutorials
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you have already created `environment`, you can upgrade it by running

```
conda env update -f environment.yml
```


## 3. Configure your IBM Q Provider

-  Create an [IBM Q](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net) account if
   you haven't already done so
-  Get an API token from the IBM Q website under â€œMy Account" > "Qiskit in
   local environment"
-  We are now going to add the necessary credentials to Qiskit. Take your
   token, here called `MY_API_TOKEN`, and pass it to the `IBMQ.save_account()`
   function:

```python
    from qiskit import IBMQ

    IBMQ.save_account('MY_API_TOKEN')
```

-  Your credentials will be stored on disk. Once they are stored, at any point
   in the future you can load and use them via:

```python
    from qiskit import IBMQ

    provider = IBMQ.load_account()
```

-  For those who do not want to save their credentials to disk, please use

```python
    from qiskit import IBMQ

    provider = IBMQ.enable_account('MY_API_TOKEN')
```

and the token will only be active for the session.


## 4. Explore the Tutorials

**Activate the environment**<BR>
For MacOS and Linux, run:

```
source activate Qiskitenv
```

For Windows, run:

```
activate Qiskitenv
```
**Note for conda users**<BR>
Verify that you have installed the right Jupyter Kernel, because in the last
conda version it's not installed by default.

```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name Qiskitenv --display-name "Python (Qiskitenv)"
```

**Start Jupyter with the index notebook**<BR>

```
jupyter notebook index.ipynb
```

## 5. [Optional] Visualizing Circuits with LaTeX
You can visualize your quantum circuits directly from Qiskit. Qiskit circuit
drawers support text, LaTeX and matplotlib. The text and matplotlib version is
entirely native to Python, and thus easy to use. The LaTeX version produces
publication-quality circuit images, but relies on some pre-requisite software.
These include the `pdflatex` compiler for rendering LaTeX documents, and the
Poppler library for converting PDF to image. To get these:

On Linux:

- Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download#unx)
- Install Poppler:
	- Run: `apt-get install -y poppler-utils`

On MacOS:

- Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download).
- Install Poppler:
	- Run: `brew install poppler`

On Windows:

- Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download).
- Install Poppler:
	- Download the [latest binary](http://blog.alivate.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/poppler-0.51_x86.7z).
	- Extract the downloaded `.7z` file into user directory: `c:\Users\<user_name>\`.
Note: You will need to have the [7zip software](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) for this.
	- Add to PATH:
		- Right click on "This PC" -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables
		- Add `C:\Users\<user_name>\poppler-0.51\bin` to the user's path.
